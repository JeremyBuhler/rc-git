**Note:** This branch, create November 15, 2020 from the main gh-pages deployed branch, is intended to preserve the previous in-person activities that are being slightly adapted and streamlined for the online learning environment. Once in-person workshops resume, this branch could be restored to gh-pages appropriately.
