## What is Version Control

Version control software tracks the changes made to a group of files.  Version control systems like Git are often associated with software development but are increasingly used for collaboration in research and academic environments.  It takes some discipline to learn and make use of version control software like Git, but there are many benefits:

* **Collaboration** - Version control helps teams work collaboratively on same set of documents without interfering with each other.
* **Versioning** - It provides a thorough log of changes to tracked files without creating multiple copies, making it easier to identify the most current version.
* **Rolling back** - Made a mistake?  Version control lets you review and undo changes, reverting to previous stages in the document's history. This can be useful when changes to your files introduce unforeseen problems.
* **Context** - Version control can help you understand how the code or writing came to be, who wrote or contributed particular parts, and who you might ask to help understand it better.
* **Backup** - While not meant to be a backup solution, version control systems mean your code and writing can be stored on multiple computers.

## What are Git and GitHub?

We often hear the terms **_Git_** and **_GitHub_** used interchangeably but it's important to understand their differences.

**_Git_** is one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. It is a free, open source tool that can be installed on your local computer to track changes made to a set of files (referred to as a "git repository" or "repo"). Git can be used independently to organize one's own work, but it's even more powerful when used with teams. Git ensures that everyone's contributions are tracked and merged effectively, and it keeps copies of all previous versions in case you need to "roll back" to an earlier state. Git is most frequently used from the command line interface, or terminal.

Git was designed for _text_ files that can be opened in a text editor (as opposed to _binary_ file formats like .pdf and .docx).  A Git repository can preserve files of any type, but only text files will benefit from all Git's features.

**_GitHub_** is a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories. It offers a web interface and provides functionality and a mixture of both free and paid services for working with such repositories. Most content hosted and developed on GitHub is open source software, but the platform is used for a wide variety of projects.  GitHub provides the online infrastructure that makes it easier for teams to collaborate using Git, and to share their work with others (any GitHub repository can have its own project website, blog, and wiki using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).)
